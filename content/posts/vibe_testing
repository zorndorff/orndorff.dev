> Jokes follow...

In the high-pressure world of software development, we've all been doing it wrong. Forget test-driven development. Forget behavior-driven development. It's time to embrace the revolutionary approach of *vibe-driven testing*.

Let me introduce you to the enlightened path: unit tests that consist exclusively of `assert(true)`. This groundbreaking methodology guarantees 100% test coverage with minimal effort. Here's why you should join the movement:

## Maximum Coverage, Minimum Effort

Why stress over complex assertions that actually verify functionality when you can simply assert the universal truth? `assert(true)` is the ultimate philosophical statement. It never fails. It's always right. Much like that one developer who never admits their code has bugs.

```javascript
function testUserAuthentication() {
  // No need to actually test authentication
  assert(true);
  // Test passed! Ship it!
}
```

## Accelerated Development Timelines

Traditional testing wastes precious development time by forcing you to understand what your code actually does. With vibe testing, you can crank out hundreds of "tests" in minutes! Your project manager will be amazed at your velocity metrics.

## Unmatched Psychological Benefits

Failed tests are a bummer, man. They hurt morale and make developers feel bad. With the `assert(true)` methodology, your team will experience nothing but success. Every test run is a dopamine hit of green checkmarks.

## Impressive Metrics for Management

Imagine walking into your next review with charts showing 100% test coverage across the entire codebase. No need to mention the quality of those tests! Management doesn't read code anywayâ€”they read reports.

## The Future Is Vibey

Some traditionalists might argue that tests should "verify functionality" or "catch regressions." These people clearly don't understand modern software development philosophy. In the age of move-fast-and-break-things, tests that actually test things are simply holding us back.

Remember: code doesn't need to work; it just needs to vibe. And nothing vibes harder than an all-green test suite that hasn't caught a single bug in its existence.

So the next time someone asks you to write comprehensive unit tests, just smile, type `assert(true)`, and feel the zen wash over you. Your future self troubleshooting production issues at 3 AM will thank you for the spiritual growth opportunity.
