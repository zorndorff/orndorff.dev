# Monorepos: The Secret Weapon Against Tech Debt

Hold on to your (code)bases, because we're about to dive into the thrilling world of monorepos and their unexpectedly effective role in managing tech debt!

## Choose Your Fighter

### Monorepo: The One Repo to Rule Them All

Monorepos are like a software development Swiss Army knife. In a monorepo setup, you've got one repository that manages all code and services with shared build tooling and common dependencies. It's the Beyoncé of repositories, and it's got a fan base like Google and Facebook, which definitely says something.

### MultiRepo: Divide and Conquer

In the land of multiple repositories (multirepo), each service or application gallantly stands alone with its very own repository. Think of it as an archipelago of codebases, each one isolated from the others. Companies can group these islands, um, repositories by domain or shared business logic. Just beware of the volcanic dependency eruptions!

### Mixed: The Hybrid Approach

If you're feeling extra spicy, you can go for a mixed approach that's like monorepo and multirepo had a code lovechild. It still involves multiple repositories, but there are some shared build tooling or common dependencies. So, variations of the same software development bloodline are present, even though they might not all live under the same roof.

## MultiRepo in Action

Picture a scenario where you've got 4-5 microservices, and each one has its own dedicated repository. Right, you're now managing a bunch of code islands. Let's see how this impacts things like spinning up a new service, infrastructure creation, and the ever-looming tech debt monster.

### Spinning a New Service Into Existence

With a multi-repo setup, creating a new service can be as tedious as a spinning class on a Monday morning. You've got to create a whole new repository and deal with its build and deployment configurations, even though you've probably got the same setup elsewhere. Not only can this lead to redundant tasks, but there's also a high risk of inconsistency, which is like having mismatched socks — slightly embarrassing and unpolished.

### Constructing Infrastructure

If you're adding a new service with a multi-repo setup, you need to deal with infrastructure. The problem is that it has to be managed and configured individually for each service. This can work, but it's a bit like inviting everyone to contribute to a potluck, and you end up with 12 lasagnas and no dessert.

### Taming the Tech Debt Beast

Tech debt and dependencies can become a bit of a beast when you have to manage them for every repository individually. As the number of services grows, keeping dependencies up-to-date across all those repositories is like trying to give a herd of cats a bath. Frustrating, messy, and time-consuming. Furthermore, resolving dependency conflicts can be a real challenge, thanks to the distributed nature of the codebase.

## Monorepo in Action

Imagine now, we have the same 4-5 microservices, but the entire codebase is managed in a single, unified monorepo. Let's see how this setup affects spinning up a new service, infrastructure creation, and vanquishing the looming tech debt beast.

### The Effortless Art of Spinning up a New Service

In the magical world of monorepos, creating a new service is like a lovely walk in the park. Shared build and deployment configurations are ready and waiting for you, just like your dog wagging its tail, eager to play fetch. Simply follow the well-trodden paths within the repository, and your new service materializes like a colorful butterfly emerging from a chrysalis.

### Seamless Infrastructure Creation

With a monorepo, the infrastructure is like one giant piece of lasagna everyone can share (without overcooking it). You create and maintain it in a consistent way for all services, eliminating the risk of forgetting to bring the dessert to the potluck of repositories.

### Tech Debt Tamed and Dependencies Dealt With

With monorepos, taming tech debt and wrangling dependencies is like gently rocking a sleeping baby. Upgrades and dependency management are streamlined and simplified across all services. Plus, having the entire codebase in one consistent workspace ensures compatibility and harmony among all your shiny code.

## The Showdown: Tech Debt and Cognitive Load

### Technical Debt

Monorepos can be the sword that slays the tech debt dragon. By centralizing dependencies and build tools within one repository, time spent on setup, maintenance, and upgrades are reduced, which means developers can focus on creating legendary features and polishing existing services.

### Cognitive Load

Cognitive load takes a dive when using monorepos. Developers can easily track down and contribute to related services, making it simpler to understand the entire codebase. On the flip side, managing multiple repositories like unruly code islands can quickly overwhelm developers, leaving them handing on for dear life with one hand while trying to fight off tech debt with the other.

In conclusion, adopting a monorepo setup for managing codebases can help reduce both the tech debt monster and the crushing weight of cognitive overload. Monorepos provide better visibility, consistency, and simplicity in handling dependencies across services, making them an excellent approach for keeping your codebase and developers happy as your organization grows. And if that doesn't make you a monorepo convert, I don't know what will!
