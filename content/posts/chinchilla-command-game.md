**Overview:** Chinchilla Command is a fast-paced, chaotic territory control game inspired by Risk and D&D elements. Players vie for dominance of a world map, employing diplomacy, military might, and absurd technologies. Be warned: alliances are fleeting, and even your closest allies might just nuke your space elevator.

**Players:** 2-4 players

**Game Setup:**

1.  **The World Map:** Use a Risk-style map, or any map of territories. The example board used a modified world map, including North America, Australia, and Africa as the start locations.
2.  **Starting Units:** Each player starts with a set number of "Regular Guys" (5-10 is a good starting number), place these in your starting territory.
3.  **Secret Powers:** Every player starts with an "Ultimate Power Up" that can be used after they have killed at least 5 of other players units.
    *   **Example Power-Ups**
         *   **Meteor Fist:** A devastating attack that eliminates multiple units in a targeted territory (as seen in the transcript)
         *   **Iron Dome:** Negates first two attacks in a territory
         *   **Laser Tank Upgrade:** Upgrades a regular tank into a Laser Tank, that deals more damage.
         *   **Space Elevator:** Construct a space elevator (See "Unique Tech" for details)
         *   **Nuclear Strike:** Elimates a small amount of units from every player, but also destroys units in your area.
4.  **First Player:** The player that has the most regular units on the board goes first

**Turn Structure:**
Each player takes their turn in the order they placed their units on the board. Each turn consists of the following phases:

1.  **Movement:** You may move as many of your units as you like each turn. You can move any of your units any number of spaces. If you enter a territory controlled by another player, you must declare your intent: 
    *   **Military Access:** If you are passing through another player's territory to reach your destination, you must pay them. (See "Military Access")
    *   **Attack:** If you are moving units into a territory controlled by another player with the intent to remove their units, an attack will be initiated. (See "Combat")
    *   **Exploration**: If you move units into an unoccupied space, the space is now considered owned by that player, the first player to occupy a region. (See "Exploration")

2.  **Action:** After movement, a player may perform **one** of the following actions:
    *   **Build a Factory:** A factory allows you to create more advanced units in the future. Requires one turn to complete a factory. One factory per territory.
    *   **Manufacture Units:** You can choose to build any of the following, in any quantity, as long as the player has an existing factory on their territory.
        *   **Regular Guys:** Basic infantry units
        *   **Horses:** Fast-moving infantry
        *   **Tanks:** Powerful, slow units
    *   **Diplomacy:** Players can attempt to make alliances, offer trades, or make demands with other players. All alliances are considered breakable (if the other player has more than 10 units)
    *   **Activate Power Up** If you have killed 5 opposing units in combat, you can activate your "Ultimate Power Up".
    *   **Unique Tech:** If you have created any kind of tech previously, you can begin using those abilities on this turn. (See "Unique Tech")

3.  **Clean Up:** At the end of your turn make sure all dead units have been taken off the board.
    *   You can choose to use "dead guys" as kindling for bonfire that dont impact the game, unless specified in a "Unique Tech."
    
**Game Mechanics:**

*   **Combat:**
    *   When attacking, you may move any number of units you have into an area occupied by another player.
    *   The attacking player and the defending player both remove 1 unit for every unit you have on the other territory.
        *   **Tank Bonus**: When attacking, every tank in your attacking forces counts as 2 units instead of 1, reducing the opposing forces by 2 instead of 1.
    *   Continue to remove opposing units from the board until the losing player's territory has been taken over or the opposing units are gone.
    *   **Power Up:** After a player successfully eliminates 5 enemy units through combat, their Ultimate Power Up is available to be used as their Action on their turn.
*   **Military Access:**
    *   When passing through a territory to reach another location, the passing player must pay the other player 10 Regular Units, which become owned by the other player.
    *   Units can be traded for tanks, 10 regular units are equal to 2 tanks, or can be traded for other deals.
    *   If a player does not want to accept military access, they can instead initiate a fight with the other player by declaring "You shall not pass!"
*   **Diplomacy:**
    *   Alliances can be formed, broken, and used for devious schemes.
    *   Trades can involve units, tech, or even promises of future support.
*  **Exploration:** 
    *   When moving units into an unoccupied territory, that territory is claimed by the player who moves into it first, and all units in that territory become owned by that player.

**Unique Tech:**
* **Factories** - Each territory can have up to one factory. A factory is created on a turn, but is not able to be used until the following turn. This is useful for making a stronger military force.
* **Laser Tanks** - An advanced upgrade to regular tanks. They are capable of inflicting a higher damage when in combat, each tank is considered to be worth 3 units instead of 2. Laser Tanks can be traded.
* **Space Elevator** A unique building that can be built in an owned territory. It acts as a weapon as well as the first step to accessing space!
    *   **Weapons Platform** A space elevator can be used as a weapons platform that can be activated as a players action, it can target one other territory and deal damage to all opposing units.
    *   **Shipyard** A space elevator can be upgraded to include a shipyard, once that is complete, all units produced can now become spaceships that can attack all opposing units.

**Victory Conditions:**

*   **Domination:** Eliminate all other players from the map. This is done by eliminating all of the units of a player from the board, thus removing them from the game.
*  **The Safe Zone:** Retreat to Australia and live out your days in peace. (or you can get nuked). This is an alternate victory condition if a player manages to have all of their remaining units move to Australia and retreat there.
    *   **Note:** Players can choose at the start of the game whether "The Safe Zone" is a victory condition or not.
*   **Space Domination** By building a space elevator, creating a shipyard and then a fleet of spaceships, one player is able to win the game by sending their fleet to another planet (Mars is a good option, as in the transcript) and claiming it for their own.

**Notes:**

*   **House Rules:** Encourage players to add their own weird rules and power-ups. If a player can come up with something clever or funny, give it a try.
*   **Adaptability:** Feel free to use different units (for example, submarines or jets), technology and/or actions.
*   **Chaos is Key:** The best part of this game is the unpredictable nature of player actions. Embrace the absurd and enjoy the chaos.

**Have fun exploring the world, betraying your friends, and unleashing the chinchilla-based chaos!**
