## Chicago Communities Prepare for Mexican Independence Day Amid Immigration Enforcement Concerns

Chicago's Mexican-American communities are moving forward with Mexican Independence Day celebrations this weekend despite warnings from Gov. J.B. Pritzker that federal immigration agents may target cultural events, leading organizers to implement unprecedented security measures involving volunteer networks and communication systems.

## Governor Warns of Coordinated Timing

Gov. Pritzker issued a stark warning Tuesday that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations appear deliberately timed to coincide with Mexican Independence Day festivities across Chicago.

"We have reason to believe that Stephen Miller chose the month of September to come to Chicago because of celebrations around Mexican Independence Day that happen here every year," [Pritzker told reporters](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/pritzker-deeply-concerned-ice-targeting-chicagos-mexican-independence-rcna228752), referring to the senior White House advisor who has spearheaded immigration enforcement policies.

The governor expressed particular concern about the targeting of community gatherings. "It breaks my heart to report that we have been told ICE will try and disrupt community picnics and peaceful gatherings," [Pritzker said](https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/09/02/immigration-raids-being-planned-around-mexican-independence-celebrations-pritzker-says/).

"The terror and cruelty is the point, not the safety of anyone living here," he emphasized, characterizing the timing as intentionally harmful to Latino communities.

## Community Organizations Mobilize Security Response

Despite the warnings, Mexican Independence Day celebrations are proceeding across Chicago with enhanced security measures coordinated by community organizations and volunteers.

In Pilsen, organizers of the 24th annual Mexican Independence Day Parade scheduled for Saturday have implemented a comprehensive volunteer security network. Vicky Lugo from the United Merchants of Pilsen Chamber of Commerce explained that [volunteer marshals will serve as "the eyes and ears" throughout the parade](https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/09/04/organizers-ready-chicagos-mexican-independence-day-events-amid-fears-of-ice-crackdown/) to alert participants if National Guard or immigration agents appear.

"We're just here to let people know that we are not going to be stopping from celebrating our roots, our heritage, our culture," Lugo stated.

The volunteer coordination includes specific communication protocols. [Volunteers stationed along the parade route will carry radios, cellphones and whistles to quickly report any issues](https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2025/09/03/mexican-independence-parade-immigration-threats), according to Rigoberto Gonzalez Jr., executive director of the Pilsen Chamber of Commerce.

## Multiple Celebrations Continue Despite Concerns

Chicago's Mexican-American community, which comprises more than 21% of the city's population according to U.S. Census data, is maintaining its cultural celebrations across multiple neighborhoods:

- **Pilsen**: The 24th annual Mexican Independence Day Parade on Saturday, September 6
- **Little Village**: The 54th annual 26th Street Mexican Independence Day Parade on Sunday, September 14
- **Grant Park**: El Grito Festival scheduled for September 13-14

Jennifer Aguilar, executive director of the Little Village Chamber of Commerce, emphasized their commitment in a statement: ["The Little Village Chamber of Commerce is fully committed to upholding our 54-year tradition of celebrating Mexican Independence Day and supporting our local business community."](https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/09/04/organizers-ready-chicagos-mexican-independence-day-events-amid-fears-of-ice-crackdown/)

## Community Leaders Frame Celebrations as Resistance

Several community leaders are characterizing this year's celebrations as acts of cultural resilience. Margarita Salgado, a community member, described the celebrations as a form of resistance, saying ["those who can go out and celebrate should"](https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/09/04/organizers-ready-chicagos-mexican-independence-day-events-amid-fears-of-ice-crackdown/) and "We need to go out and show that we are a strong community."

Some organizers view [hosting celebrations this year as "almost like an act of resistance"](https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/09/04/organizers-ready-chicagos-mexican-independence-day-events-amid-fears-of-ice-crackdown/) amid the federal administration's immigration crackdown.

"People are ready to lift our voices, to celebrate our culture, our heritage and our history," said Vicky Lugo from the United Merchants Pilsen Chamber of Commerce.

## Mayor Johnson Coordinates City Response

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson joined the state's opposition to federal immigration enforcement during cultural celebrations. Johnson signed an executive order Saturday [barring the city's police department from collaborating with federal officers conducting civil immigration enforcement operations](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/31/nx-s1-5524276/chicagos-mayor-pushes-back-as-trump-administration-readies-immigration-crackdown).

"We are going to protect the humanity of every single person in the city of Chicago," [Johnson stated during Labor Day remarks](https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/09/02/immigration-raids-being-planned-around-mexican-independence-celebrations-pritzker-says/).

The mayor also reframed the enforcement concerns, stating, ["We don't have an immigration crisis in Chicago, we have a gun crisis."](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/pritzker-deeply-concerned-ice-targeting-chicagos-mexican-independence-rcna228752)

## Historical Context and Community Impact

Mexican Independence Day, celebrated on September 16, holds deep cultural significance for Chicago's Latino community. Cook County has the third-largest population of Mexican immigrants and Mexican Americans in the country, behind Los Angeles County, California and Harris County, Texas.

The concerns about immigration enforcement during cultural celebrations echo broader national patterns. Earlier this year, organizers canceled the Cinco de Mayo Parade in Little Village over similar concerns about immigration enforcement, demonstrating the ongoing impact on community cultural life.

In Oregon, the city of Hillsboro moved its annual El Grito celebration online due to [fears over escalated immigration enforcement](https://www.opb.org/article/2025/08/29/hillsboro-el-grito-celebration-moves-online-immigration-enforcement/), showing how enforcement concerns are affecting celebrations nationwide.

## Safety Resources and Community Preparation

Governor Pritzker advised community members to "Know your rights, film things that you see happening in your neighborhoods and your streets and share them with the news media. [Authoritarians thrive on your silence. Be loud for America](https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/09/02/immigration-raids-being-planned-around-mexican-independence-celebrations-pritzker-says/)."

Community advocacy groups like the Raise the Floor Alliance have been [checking in with leaders, flyering work sites, and doing peer outreach](https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/09/04/organizers-ready-chicagos-mexican-independence-day-events-amid-fears-of-ice-crackdown/), with leaders saying "We're going to equip our people, and we'll be ready."

The Chicago Police Department is coordinating with parade organizers to ensure public safety during the celebrations, while maintaining the city's sanctuary city policies that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.

## Federal Operations and Timeline

According to Pritzker's statements, [federal agents began staging for operations Monday by moving military vehicles onto federal properties in the state and relocating federal agents from Los Angeles to Chicago](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/pritzker-deeply-concerned-ice-targeting-chicagos-mexican-independence-rcna228752).

The New York Times reported that Department of Homeland Security officials requested to use Naval Station Great Lakes near North Chicago for operations housing 250 personnel, including tactical operations centers and storage for less-lethal weapons.

Pritzker emphasized that while state and local law enforcement will not interfere with immigration enforcement, they also will not provide assistance to federal operations.

## Looking Forward

As Chicago's Mexican-American communities prepare for this weekend's celebrations, the events represent a test of community resilience and cultural preservation in the face of federal enforcement concerns.

The enhanced security measures implemented by community organizers - including volunteer communication networks with radios and whistles - demonstrate both the challenges facing immigrant communities and their determination to maintain cultural traditions.

"We do have a contingency plan that we are going to have volunteers through the parade route to help secure areas and also if they see any immigration agents we're going to be communicating," organizers explained, balancing celebration with necessary precautions.

The celebrations proceed as planned, with community leaders emphasizing that Mexican Independence Day represents not just a cultural holiday, but an affirmation of community strength and unity in Chicago's Latino neighborhoods.
