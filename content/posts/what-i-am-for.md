I think we've slid into a trap where our political beliefs are defined as being "in opposition to" another groups. 

This ensures an antagonistic, us-verses-them mentality while the "elites" watch.

So here's a list of things this dirty liberal is for, not against...


 *The 8-Hour Day* The idea that your life isn't owned by your employer. This standard was the result of decades of bloody struggle by labor activists and unions against 10, 12, and even 16-hour workdays. The slogan was "8 hours for work, 8 hours for rest, 8 hours for what we will."
   * Citation: "Eight-hour day." Wikipedia, Wikimedia Foundation, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-hour_day


 *The Weekend* A direct result of the fight for the 5-day work week. The concept of having two consecutive days off for rest, family, and community was a radical demand, not a gift from benevolent employers.
   * Citation: "Workweek and weekend." Wikipedia, Wikimedia Foundation, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workweek_and_weekend.
 * A Minimum Wage. The fundamental principle that there is a floor below which the price of human labor cannot fall. While we argue about the level, the very existence of a wage floor is a progressive idea that rejects the notion that a person's time can be worth pennies an hour.
   * Citation: "Minimum wage in the United States." Wikipedia, Wikimedia Foundation, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_wage_in_the_United_States.
 * Social Security. The belief that a society should not discard its elders into poverty when they are no longer able to work. This system of social insurance, where we all pay in for a collective benefit, is a cornerstone of the public good.
   * Citation: "Social Security (United States)." Wikipedia, Wikimedia Foundation, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_(United_States).
 * Workplace Safety Regulations (OSHA). I am for guard rails on high platforms, ventilation in factories, and emergency shut-offs for machinery. The idea that your job shouldn't kill you was not a given; it was fought for and legislated over the protests of companies concerned about costs.
   * Citation: "Occupational Safety and Health Administration." Wikipedia, Wikimedia Foundation, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration.
 * Child Labor Laws. The radical notion that childhood should be for education and development, not for working in mines and factories. As some jurisdictions attempt to roll back protections for teenage workers in 2025, it's a reminder that this victory is never permanent.
   * Citation: "Child labor laws in the United States." Wikipedia, Wikimedia Foundation, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_labor_laws_in_the_United_States.
 * Public Libraries and Parks. Decommodified public spaces where you can exist, learn, and rest without the expectation of spending money. They are a profound statement that not every aspect of human life must be monetized.
   * Citations: "Public library." Wikipedia, Wikimedia Foundation, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_library and "Public park." Wikipedia, Wikimedia Foundation, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_park.
 * Overtime Pay. The right to be compensated at a premium for hours worked beyond the standard 40-hour week. This discourages employers from overworking their staff and honors the fact that your personal time is valuable.
   * Citation: "Overtime." Wikipedia, Wikimedia Foundation, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime.
 * The US Postal Service. A public service mandated to serve every single address in the nation, from a dense city block to a remote rural home, for the same price. It is a tool for democracy and commerce that prioritizes universal access over profit.
   * Citation: "United States Postal Service." Wikipedia, Wikimedia Foundation, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Postal_Service.
 * Unemployment Insurance. The understanding that losing your job shouldn't automatically mean losing your home and dignity. It is a collective insurance system that provides a crucial buffer for workers and acts as an economic stabilizer during downturns.
   * Citation: "Unemployment benefits in the United States." Wikipedia, Wikimedia Foundation, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment_benefits_in_the_United_States.
 * Clean Air and Water Acts. The assertion that corporations do not have an unlimited right to pollute our shared environment. The right to breathable air and drinkable water is a public good that must be protected by the government from private industrial interests.
   * Citations: "Clean Air Act (United States)." Wikipedia, Wikimedia Foundation, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Air_Act_(United_States) and "Clean Water Act." Wikipedia, Wikimedia Foundation, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Water_Act.
 * The 30-Year Fixed-Rate Mortgage. A government-backed innovation designed to make stable housing accessible to working families, shielding them from the whims of interest rate spikes and predatory lending.
   * Citation: "Fixed-rate mortgage." Wikipedia, Wikimedia Foundation, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-rate_mortgage.
 * Food and Drug Safety (FDA). The belief that you should be able to trust that your food won't poison you and your medicine is what it claims to be. This is a direct result of progressive-era regulation fighting against corporate malpractice.
   * Citation: "Food and Drug Administration." Wikipedia, Wikimedia Foundation, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration.
 * Public K-12 Education. The foundational idea that every child, regardless of their parents' wealth, deserves access to a free, quality education. It is one of society's most essential investments in its own future.
   * Citation: "Public education." Wikipedia, Wikimedia Foundation, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_education.
 * The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The legal and moral assertion that our society and economy must be accessible to everyone. Curb cuts, ramps, and workplace accommodations are a declaration that a person's worth and right to participate in society is not defined by their physical ability.
   * Citation: "Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990." Wikipedia, Wikimedia Foundation, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans_with_Disabilities_Act_of_1990.
