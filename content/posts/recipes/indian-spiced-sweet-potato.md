### Instructions
1. **Make the Curry Paste:**
   - Combine shallots, garlic, lime leaves, peanuts, galangal, lemongrass, cumin, coriander, and rehydrated chilies in a blender. Blend on high speed until smooth.

2. **Prepare the Sweet Potatoes:**
   - In a large pot, heat vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Add curry paste and cook for 2-3 minutes until it deepens in color and dries slightly.
   - Deglaze the pot with chicken stock. Add palm sugar, coconut milk, and optional lime leaves and hondashi.
   - Stir in the sweet potato chunks. Bring to a boil, cover, and reduce heat to low. Simmer for 10-12 minutes until slightly softened but not fully cooked.

3. **Bake the Casserole:**
   - Pour sweet potato mixture into a greased 9x13 baking dish. Cover with foil and bake in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for 30 minutes.

4. **Prepare Fried Shallots:**
   - In a cold Dutch oven, fill halfway with vegetable oil. Add sliced shallots and turn the heat to high. Fry, stirring regularly, until golden brown. Remove and drain on paper towels, seasoning with salt.

5. **Assemble and Serve:**
   - After baking, top the casserole with fried shallots. If desired, add dollops of whipped coconut cream, fresh red fresno peppers, and Thai basil leaves before serving.
