### Ingredients
- 3 lbs boneless chuck beef (various cuts)
- Light olive oil (for sautéing)
- 3 cups red wine (such as Burgundy)
- 2 cups beef stock
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- 1/2 teaspoon thyme
- 1 bay leaf
- 2 cloves garlic (whole)
- Salt to taste
- Fresh mushrooms (1-2 cups, quartered)
- Butter (1 tablespoon for onions, and some for sautéing mushrooms)
- Water (for braised onions)
- Optional for serving: boiled potatoes, green salad, and French bread.

### Instructions

#### Preparing the Beef
1. Select and cut 3 lbs of boneless chuck beef into bite-sized pieces.
2. Dry the meat thoroughly with paper towels to ensure it browns properly.
3. Heat a large pan with enough light olive oil to coat the bottom.

#### Browning the Beef
4. Once the oil is hot (not smoking), add the beef in batches without crowding the pan.
5. Brown the beef on all sides, taking about 4-5 minutes per batch.
6. Transfer the browned meat to a casserole pot.

#### Deglazing and Adding Liquid
7. Add red wine to the hot pan and scrape up any brown bits (deglaze) to enhance flavor.
8. Pour the deglazed wine over the browned beef in the casserole.
9. Add beef stock until the meat is barely covered, approximately 2 cups.
10. Stir in tomato paste, thyme, bay leaf, and whole garlic cloves.

#### Cooking the Stew
11. Taste and adjust salt, then simmer the mixture on the stove.
12. Once simmering, cover the casserole and place it in a preheated oven at 325°F.
13. Cook slowly in the oven for 3-4 hours until the beef is tender.

#### Braising the Onions
14. Peel whole small onions, piercing the root end to keep them intact.
15. In a pan, add water (half-covering the onions), butter, and salt, then bring to a simmer.
16. Cover and simmer for 25 minutes until tender and still whole.

#### Sautéing the Mushrooms
17. Clean and quarter the mushrooms.
18. In a non-stick pan, melt butter and heat oil until the butter's foam subsides.
19. Add the quartered mushrooms and sauté over high heat for 3-5 minutes until lightly browned.

#### Finishing the Stew
20. Once the beef is tender, remove it from the oven and strain the sauce to eliminate excess fat.
21. Taste the sauce and adjust seasoning with more salt or pepper as needed.
22. Mix softened butter with flour to create a paste (beurre manié) for thickening.
23. Stir the paste into the sauce and bring it back to a soft boil for a few seconds.
24. Add back the beef, braised onions, and sautéed mushrooms to the sauce and heat gently.

#### Serving
25. Serve the boeuf bourguignon hot with boiled potatoes and a green salad on the side.
26. Complement the meal with a glass of the same red wine used in cooking.

### Notes
- Make ahead: The stew can be cooked a day in advance and reheated gently.
- For variations, feel free to use lamb or chicken, adjusting cooking times accordingly.
